# This playbook is specifically provided for scenarios where cinch will be used
# to manage configurations of Jenkins masters that were *not* created by cinch,
# but by some other method, either manually or via another configuration
# management tool.  In this case, it's highly recommended to configure backups
# before running cinch against a Jenkins master for the first time.

# For this playbook to succeed, the thinBackup plugin must be installed, a
# valid Jenkins user with admin rights must be provided, along with a target
# directory for the backup data to live.

# It's important to avoid submitting a Jenkins admin username that does not
# exist on the target Jenkins master.  If this happens, then the
# jenkins_user_api module will happily create a useless Jenkins user with the
# name given, which is best avoided.

# Example:
# ansible-playbook -u root --private-key /path/to/key
# -i 'jenkins.example.com', jenkins_backup.yml
# -e "jenkins_admin=example_username"
# -e "backup_dir=/var/lib/jenkins/thinBackup_data"
