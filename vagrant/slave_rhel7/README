This Vagrantfile spins up a jenkins slave only. There is no master
that it is attacehd to. The slave will be based on a rhel7.2 box.
Since these boxes are not available to the general public, you
will need to either update the Vagrantfile with the name and URL
of your accessible base box or you will need to import the box.
Importing can be done with the command

``vagrant box add --name rhel7.2 <url to box>``

You will still need to modify the Vagrantfile to update the value
of the rhel_base variable to point to the base directory of your
available RHEL7 repositories. Since those files are also under
license, you will need to have access to such a repository in order
for the Ansible playbooks to properly install the software.
